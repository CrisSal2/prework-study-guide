- The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a tool created to contain easy access to information on important basics of web development. 
- I created this web app to keep track of important steps and to keep a strong understanding of key concepts. 
- The Prework Study Guide Webpage holds 4 main topics (HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript) with key information and concepts, making it easy to keep track of.
- Creating this study guide has taught me how to get connected with the developement community and introduced me to a new computational language.
